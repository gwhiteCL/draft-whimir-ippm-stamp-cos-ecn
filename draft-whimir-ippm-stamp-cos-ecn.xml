    <abstract>
      <t>The Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) enables
    one-way and round-trip measurement of network metrics between IP hosts, and has a facility for defining
    optional extensions. This document updates the definition of the Class of Service TLV (originally defined
    in RFC 8972) to enable the measurement of manipulation of the value of the Explicit Congestion
    Notification (ECN) field of the IP header by middleboxes between two STAMP hosts, and to
    enable discovery and measurement of paths that provide differential treatment of packets depending
    on the value of their ECN field.</t>

    <section>
      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>   <xref target="RFC8972"/> defined several extensions to the Simple Two-way Active
   Measurement Protocol (STAMP).  Among those is a Class of Service (CoS)
   TLV that enables measurements that utilize the Differentiated Services Code Point
   (DSCP) marking in both directions.  Also, the CoS TLV
   supports outbound measurements that utilize the Explicit Congestion
   Notification (ECN) field, but it lacked support for such measurements on the return path.
   Experience deploying STAMP and its extensions
   demonstrated that it is helpful to an operator to monitor ECN's
   consistency in both directions.  This specification updates
   the definition of the CoS TLV in a backward compatible manner to
   support monitoring of ECN in the return path of the STAMP test
   session.

        <li>Reserved: twelve-bit field; <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be zeroed on transmission and ignored on receipt.</li>
      </ul>


      <t>A STAMP Session-Reflector that receives a test packet with the CoS
      TLV <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the CoS TLV in the reflected test packet.
      The Session-Reflector <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> copy the value of the DSCP and ECN fields of
      the IP header of the received STAMP test packet into the DSCP2 and EC2
      fields, respectively, in the CoS TLV in the reflected test packet.
      The Session-Reflector <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use the local policy to verify whether the
      use of the value of the DSCP1 field is permitted in the domain.
      If it is, the Session-Reflector <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> set the DSCP field's value in the
      IP header of the reflected test packet equal to the value of the DSCP1
      field of the received test packet.
      Otherwise, the Session-Reflector <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use the DSCP value of the received
      STAMP packet and set the value of the RPD field to 1.
      Upon receiving the reflected packet, if the value of the RPD field is 0,
      the Session-Sender will save the DSCP value for analysis of the CoS in
      the reverse direction.
      If the value of the RP field in the received reflected packet is 1, only
      CoS in the forward direction can be analyzed.</t>

      <t>The Session-Reflector <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> set the ECN value in the IP header of the
      reflected STAMP test packet to the value of the EC1 field.
      The Session-Reflector <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> set the RPE field in the CoS TLV in the
      reflected test packet to the value 0b01.
      As a result, the Session-Sender can detect whether the recommended
      values for DSCP and ECN fields in the reflected packets were used by
      inspecting the value of the RPD and RPE fields in the received
      reflected test packet.</t>

    <section>
      <name>Interoperability with RFC 8972</name>

      <t> The extended CoS TLV defined in this draft is backward compatible with
      the specification in <xref target="RFC8972" section="4.4"/>.  The handling of the DSCP1, DSCP2, EC2 and RPD fields defined here is identical to the handling defined for the equivalent fields in <xref target="RFC8972" section="4.4"/>.</t>

      <t>Consider a case when an implementation that supports this specification performs
      as Session-Sender, and the intended Session-Reflector's support of the CoS TLV
      is according to <xref target="RFC8972" section="4.4"/>.
      If the operator requires monitoring ECN in the reverse direction, the value
      of the EC1 field will be set to a non-zero value.
      Because the Session-Reflector would treat the EC1 field as part of the
      Reserved field, it would ignore its value as per <xref target="RFC8972"
      section="4.4"/>.
      Further, the Session-Reflector would treat the RPE field as part of the
      Reserved field and thus it would send the value 0b00 in the reflected STAMP
      packet, rather than sending the value 0b01.
      Consequently, the Session-Sender will determine that the ECN value in the
      IP header of the reflected test packet was not set to the
      requested value.</t>

      <t>Also, this specification supports the case when the Session-Reflector
      supports the extended CoS TLV as defined in this specification and the
      Session-Sender supports the CoS TLV according to <xref target="RFC8972"
      section="4.4"/>.
      In that scenario, the Session-Sender will set its <xref target="RFC8972"/>
      Reserved field to zeros.
      The Session-Reflector will interpret the first two bits of that field as
      the EC1 field, as shown in <xref target="TLV"/> and thus will set the
      value of the ECN field in the IP header of the reflected packet to
      0b00. Further the Session-Reflector will set the RPE field to 0b01.
      The Session-Sender will treat the RPE field as part of the Reserved field
      and will ignore its value.</t>

       <t>As this specification defined the mechanism to test ECN mapping, this
       document inherits all the security considerations discussed in
       [RFC2474].  Monitoring and optional control of ECN for a reflected
       STAMP test packet using the extended CoS TLV may be used across the
       Internet so that the Session-Sender and the Session-Reflector are
       located in different domains.
