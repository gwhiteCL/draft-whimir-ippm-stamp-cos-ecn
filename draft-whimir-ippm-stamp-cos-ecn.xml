    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an optional extension to the Class of Service
   monitoring functionality of Simple Two-way Active Measurement
   Protocol that enables the upstream monitoring of the Explicit
   Congestion Notification and thus updates RFC 8972.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section>
      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>   <xref target="RFC8972"/> defined several extensions to Simple Two-way Active
   Measurement Protocol (STAMP).  Among those is Class of Service (CoS)
   TLV that enables monitoring of the Differential Services Code Point
   (DSCP) marking in downstream and upstream directions.  Also, CoS TLV
   supports downstream monitoring of the Explicit Congestion
   Notification (ECN).  Experience deploying STAMP and its extensions
   demonstrated that it is helpful to an operator to monitor ECN's
   consistency in the upstream direction.  This specification defines
   the extension of the CoS TLV in a backward compatible manner to
   support monitoring of ECN in the upstream direction of the STAMP test
   session.

        <li>Reserved: twelve-bit field; MUST be zeroed on transmission and ignored on receipt.</li>
      </ul>


<t>A STAMP Session-Reflector that receives a test packet with the CoS TLV MUST include the CoS TLV in the reflected test packet.
The Session-Reflector MUST copy the value of the DSCP and ECN
fields of the IP header of the received STAMP test packet into the
DSCP2 and EC2 fields, respectively, in the CoS TLV in the reflected test packet.

  The Session-Reflector MUST use the local policy to verify whether the use of the value of the DSCP1 field is permitted in the domain. If it is, the Session-Reflector MUST set the DSCP field's value in the IP header of the reflected test packet equal to the value of the DSCP1 field of the received test packet. Otherwise, the Session-Reflector MUST use the DSCP value of the received STAMP packet and set the value of the RPD field to 1. Upon receiving the reflected packet, if the value of the RPD field is 0, the Session-Sender will save the DSCP value for analysis of the CoS in the reverse direction. If the value of the RP field in the received reflected packet is 1, only CoS in the forward direction can be analyzed.</t>

<t>
   The Session-Reflector MUST set the ECN value in the IP header of the reflected STAMP test packet to the value of the EC1 field.
   The Session-Reflector MUST set the RPE
   field in the CoS TLV in the reflected test packet to the value 0b01.  As a result, the
   Session-Sender can detect whether the recommended values for DSCP and
   ECN fields in the reflected packets were used by inspecting the value
   of the RPD and RPE fields in the received reflected test packet.

    <section>
      <name>Interoperability with RFC 8972</name>

      <t> The extended CoS TLV defined in this draft is backward compatible with
      the specification in <xref target="RFC8972" section="4.4"/>.  The handling of the DSCP1, DSCP2, EC2 and RPD fields defined here is identical to the handling defined for the equivalent fields in <xref target="RFC8972" section="4.4"/>.</t>

      <t>Consider a case when an implementation that supports this specification performs
      as Session-Sender, and the intended Session-Reflector's support of the CoS TLV
      is according to <xref target="RFC8972" section="4.4"/>.
      If the operator requires monitoring ECN in the reverse direction, the value
      of the EC1 field will be set to a non-zero value.
      Because the Session-Reflector would treat the EC1 field as part of the
      Reserved field, it would ignore its value as per <xref target="RFC8972"
      section="4.4"/>.
      Further, the Session-Reflector would treat the RPE field as part of the
      Reserved field and thus it would send the value 0b00 in the reflected STAMP
      packet, rather than sending the value 0b01.
      Consequently, the Session-Sender will determine that the ECN value in the
      IP header of the reflected test packet was not set to the
      requested value.</t>

      <t>Also, this specification supports the case when the Session-Reflector
      supports the extended CoS TLV as defined in this specification and the
      Session-Sender supports the CoS TLV according to <xref target="RFC8972"
      section="4.4"/>.
      In that scenario, the Session-Sender will set its <xref target="RFC8972"/>
      Reserved field to zeros.
      The Session-Reflector will interpret the first two bits of that field as
      the EC1 field, as shown in <xref target="TLV"/> and thus will set the
      value of the ECN field in the IP header of the reflected packet to
      0b00. Further the Session-Reflector will set the RPE field to 0b01.
      The Session-Sender will treat the RPE field as part of the Reserved field
      and will ignore its value.</t>

       <t>As this specification defined the mechanism to test ECN mapping, this
       document inherits all the security considerations discussed in
       [RFC2474].  Monitoring and optional control of ECN for a reflected
       STAMP test packet using the extended CoS TLV may be used across the
       Internet so that the Session-Sender and the Session-Reflector are
       located in different domains.
